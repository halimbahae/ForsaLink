# ForsaLink - **Connecting Talent with Opportunity**

## Introduction

Welcome to ForsaLink! This project aims to create a platform that connects students seeking internships with companies offering valuable opportunities. Our goal is to simplify the process and provide a secure, efficient way to match talent with the right opportunities.

## Project Vision

Over the past two years, many individuals have reached out to me on LinkedIn and WhatsApp, inquiring about internship opportunities. Realizing the need for a streamlined solution, I decided to launch ForsaLink. This initiative will help students find internships by matching them with reputable companies.

## Current Status

We are in the initial stages of developing ForsaLink. The app will start with a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focusing on the core functionality of linking offers and demands through LinkedIn profiles. This ensures no confidential information like phone numbers or addresses is shared, maintaining user privacy.

## Features

- **Profile Matching**: Connect students and companies using LinkedIn profiles.
- **Secure and Private**: No need for phone numbers or addresses, just LinkedIn links.
- **Community-Driven**: Built by a community of developers, marketers, and supporters passionate about making a difference.
